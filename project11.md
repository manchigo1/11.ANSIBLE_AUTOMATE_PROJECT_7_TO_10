Installing Ansible on Jenkins Server

We install ansible on our jenkins server and rename it to Jenkins-Ansible

sudo apt update

sudo apt install ansible
![jenkins ansible](./images/jenkins%20ansible.png)
![sudo apt ansible](./images/sudo%20apt%20ansible.png)

Create a new repository called ansible-config-mgt on github and set up webhooks on it.

https://<jenkins_url:port/github-webhooks>

On the Jenkins server, create a job called ansible and configure automatic builds when a trigger is made on the ansible-config-mgt directory via GITScm polling.

Test configuration by updating a README file on github.

Prepare Development using VSCode

Download and install vscode which will be used to write and edit code.

Ansible Configuration

Clone ansible-config-mgt repo on local machine and create a new branch for development 


Create a playbooks directory for storing playbooks
Create an inventory directory for storing inventory files
In the playbooks folder, create a common.yml file
In the inventory folder, create dev.yml, prod.yml, staging.yml and uat.yml for dev, prod, staging and uat environments respectively.

Setting Up Inventory

we create inventories to execute Linux commands on remote hosts, and ensure that it is the intended configuration on a particular server that occurs. It is important to have a way to organize our hosts in such an Inventory.

We need to ssh into our target servers defined in the /inventory/dev.yaml

using SSH-Agent to upload our ssh public key to the jenkins-ansible server

eval `ssh-agent -s`
ssh-add <path-to-private-key>
Confirm the key has been added with the command below, you should see the name of your key

ssh-add -l
Now, ssh into your Jenkins-Ansible server using ssh-agent

ssh -A ubuntu@public-ip
updating our /inventory/dev.yaml

[nfs]
<NFS-Server-Private-IP-Address> ansible_ssh_user='ec2-user'

[webservers]
<Web-Server1-Private-IP-Address> ansible_ssh_user='ec2-user'
<Web-Server2-Private-IP-Address> ansible_ssh_user='ec2-user'

[db]
<Database-Private-IP-Address> ansible_ssh_user='ec2-user' 

[lb]
<Load-Balancer-Private-IP-Address> ansible_ssh_user='ubuntu'
Creating a Common Playbook

Update code in /playbooks/common.yaml

 ---
- name: update web, nfs and db servers
  hosts: webservers, nfs, db
  remote_user: ec2-user
  become: yes
  become_user: root
  tasks:
    - name: ensure wireshark is at the latest version
      yum:
        name: wireshark
        state: latest

- name: update LB server
  hosts: lb
  remote_user: ubuntu
  become: yes
  become_user: root
  tasks:
    - name: Update apt repo
      apt: 
        update_cache: yes

    - name: ensure wireshark is at the latest version
      apt:
        name: wireshark
        state: latest
Next push code into repository and create a pull request to the main branch. Jenkins checksout the code and builds an artifact that is published on the ansible server.

RUN FIRST ANSIBLE TEST

ansible-playbook -i /var/lib/jenkins/jobs/ansible/builds/<build-number>/archive/inventory/dev.yml /var/lib/jenkins/jobs/ansible/builds/<build-number>/archive/playbooks/common.yml
